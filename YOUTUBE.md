## Using YouTube Studio

YouTube provides a service that allows you to schedule unlisted broadcasts ahead of time. You can use the https://studio.youtube.com website to broadcast directly from the laptop for ad-hoc broadcasts, but when the broadcast is scheduled in advance, you'll need to use a third-party app to send the stream to YouTube, such as [OBS](https://obsproject.com/).

The reason we schedule our broadcasts ahead of time is that we want to keep the URL unlisted, and we need to know the URL ahead of time. Our ward clerk sends an email to ward members on Friday or Saturday with the links to Sacrament Meeting and the adult and youth classes.

### Setup

Because the YouTube Studio website seems to change every few months, I won't outline all of the steps here, but I will list the most important settings that we use for our Sacrament Meeting broadcasts.
